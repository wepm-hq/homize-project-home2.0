                <h1>Types of Work</h1>
                <p>All work is defined as either task level or project work. By creating two distinct workstreams for
                    all work
                    coming into
                    the teams. We can build in automation to help the team achieve more and reduce the amount of work in
                    progress (WIP).</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Task or Bugs are primarily based on two different criteria.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Can the work be done by a single person?</li>
                <li>Will it take less than 8 man hours to complete?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Project work is defined as primarily needing some level of discovery to define the level of effort
                (LOE) before work can
                begin.
            </p>

                Trello Organization
            </h1>
            <p>
                Trello is the project management tool of choice for the development team. This tool allows the team to
                track in-flight
                work while being flexible enough to be modified to meet the growing needs of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Work in Trello is organized into 2 different boards. The Task/Bug board is where the majority of the
                work is captured.
                Each card equals an individual task with a single owner. The Project board provides a high level
                overview of each of the
                various projects that are in flight. Each card equals a project and the milestones will be listed in
                each card. A link
                to the project plan housed in google sheets will be saved under each card.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Task/Bug Board is organized with the following columns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Backlog - Unapproved: This is a parking lot of work that has been submitted. The backlog is reviewed
                    on a weekly basis
                    and any approved work is moved into the “Selected for Dev - Approved Tasks”. Before a task can be
                    moved into the
                    selected for dev column the card needs to have a budget (approved number of hours that should be
                    used to complete the
                    task), a due date, and a priority.
                </li>
                <li>Selected for Dev - Approved: This where all approved work is moved to. Tasks will remain in this
                    column until they are
                    picked up by the team. The goal is to limit the amount of work in progress (WIP) to prevent tasks
                    from getting lost and
                    abandoned.</li>
                <li>
                    In Progress: Only tasks that are actively being worked on should be in this column. Work that is on
                    deck or hasn’t
                    started should be in the “Selected for Dev” column. This includes work that is “blocked”. Any tasks
                    that are blocked
                    should remain in the In Progress column while efforts are being done to unblock the task. If the
                    issue remains blocked
                    after 3 or 4 days then the task needs to be moved out of the In Progress so more work can be pulled
                    in. The WIP limit
                    for this column is 2 tasks per person. If ownership needs to move between people then they need to
                    be added as the only
                    member of the task.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Done: all completed work is moved to this column for final review and acceptance by the stakeholder
                    who requested the
                    task. Completed work will be archived on a weekly basis. If the card that has been moved into the
                    done column is a bug
                    that is in Bugherd it is the responsibility of the developer to update Bugherd accordingly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            </h1>
            <p>
                All projects have to be prioritized and go through an approval process. This process will ensure that
                the team is
                working on the things that are the most important things. Priority lives with Mike Hittle and is
                reviewed on an ongoing
                basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Projects are submitted through the Project form which will automatically create a trello card. That card
                is assigned to
                Mike H to add a project budget and add the priority. This allows for a clean pipeline of approved work
                for the team.
                This allows the business to control development costs and ensure the ROI is pointed in the right
                direction.

                Deployment Tracking
            </h1>
            <p>
                It is necessary to build in a process to track all changes in the production environment to ensure that
                there is
                transparency and accountability for all changes. Knowing what changes have recently happened allows for
                quicker problem
                resolution. This will reduce the chance that customers (users) have a negative experience which may lead
                to and dip in
                sales revenue.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Deployments will be classified as scheduled or ad-hoc (now).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Production deployments should only be executed during the planned maintenance window (Thursdays @ 4p
                    PST / 7p
                    EST).Ad-hoc deployments require approval from Mike Hittle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Before any deployment a developer is required to complete a production deployment form. There are no
                    exceptions allowed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Planned deployments will go through a peer-review / stakeholder process to ensure that all questions
                    and concerns are
                    answered prior to the change. If a deployment is given a “no go” then all questions or concerns must
                    be addressed before
                    the change is made.
                </li>

                    Testing in a non-production environment is a requirement if possible.
